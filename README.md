# Identifying Pictures Using Supervised Learning: Comparison of Different Classifiers
A basic comparison of 7 different supervised machine learning models using sklearn. 

## How to Run

Download the dataset from here:
'https://www.kaggle.com/alessiocorrado99/animals10'

Then put it in the project folder and edit the path variable inside 'training.py' accordingly.
Run 'training.py' to get the necessary .h5 files

After these steps, open 'final.py', edit the path variables and run.
